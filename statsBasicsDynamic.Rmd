## Why We Need Hypothesis Tests? {.bigger}

> A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a **population** to determine which statement is best supported by the **sample** data.

# Population vs Sample

---

How well a sample statistic estimates an underlying population parameter?

<div class="centered">
![](statsBasics-figure/conf_int_sample_pops.png){width=80%}
</div>

## Population

> - Let's measure the mean fluorescence intensity (FI) of cells subject to a treatment. 
> - The FI in single cells varies across the population and follows a distribution with $\mu = 5$ (mean).

<div class="centered">
```{r, fig.height=4}
nPopMn = 5.
nPopSD = 1.

{
  plot(function(x) dnorm(x, mean = nPopMn, sd = nPopSD), 0, 10,
       xlab = "Fluorescence intensity in single cells",
       ylab = "Density")
  abline(v = 5, lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = "#de3765")

         lwd = 2, lty = 2,
         col = "#de3765", bty = "n")
}
```
</div>

## Sample

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:45%'>
> - We're interested in estimating the mean FI in the cell **population**. 
> - In experiments we cannot *access* the true population mean unless we measure everything. 
> - *Sampling* the reality is the next best thing we can do!


> - A sample consists of measurements of FI in individual cells.
> - A sample mean is the mean calculated from a sample.

## Sample vs population statistic

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:45%'>
> - Let's measure FI in 6 different fields of view (FOV), with 10 cells in each FOV. 
> - We calculate the mean FI for every FOV and obtain 6 sample means.
> - The mean FI from each FOV is usually far from the population mean (=5)!

## Sampling distribution

# Hypothesis testing

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
This new measurement *seems* quite different from the **population** mean (=5).

> - Alternative hypothesis: the population mean differs from the hypothesized mean (=5)

## Test hypotheses

<div class="centered">

Draw random samples from the **same** population. 

Compare sample means and the corresponding CI to the population mean.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Multiple sample drawings
shinyAppDir(appDir = "statsBasics-apps/multiCI",
            options = list(width = "100%", height = 700)
)
```

## Example of CI

From [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/estimating-confidence-ap/introduction-confidence-intervals/a/interpreting-confidence-levels-and-confidence-intervals):

> A baseball coach was curious about the true mean speed of fastball pitches in his league. The coach recorded the speed in kilometers per hour of each fastball in a random sample of 
100 pitches and constructed a 95%, percent confidence interval for the mean speed. The resulting interval was (110,120).


<div class="green2">Correct statement:</div>

We're 95% **confident** that the interval (110,120) captured the true mean pitch speed.

<div class="red2">Incorrect statement:</div>

> - There is a 95% **probability** that the true mean is within the (110, 120) interval.
> - About 95% of pitches in the sample **were** between 110 and 120.
> - If the coach took another sample of 100 pitches, there's a 95% **chance** the sample mean would be between 110 and 120.

## P values vs CI

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
> - You can use either P values or confidence intervals to determine whether your results are statistically significant.
> - If a hypothesis test produces both, these results will agree.
> - The confidence level is equivalent to $1 - \alpha$.
</div>

<div class='right' style='float:right;width:48%'>
> - If the P value is less than the significance level $\alpha$, the hypothesis test is statistically significant.
> - If the confidence interval does not contain the null hypothesis value, the results are statistically significant.
> - If the P value is less than $\alpha$, the confidence interval will not contain the null hypothesis value.

# P-value vs CI

shinyAppDir(appDir = "statsBasics-apps/pVal_vs_CI",
            options = list(width = "100%", height = 700)
)
```

## P values vs CI II

<div class='left' style='float:left;width:48%'>
The **significance level** defines the distance the sample mean must be from the null hypothesis to be considered statistically significant.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
{
  fPlotShadedTdist(nSz = nSz, nMn = nPopMn, nSD = nSampleSD, 
                   vertLines = c(nPopMn, nSampleMn), 
                   vertLinesCol = c("#de3765", "#7cb5ec"),
                   nFrac = 0.05, xlim = c(2,8), inv = T, 
                   main = "Sampling distribution, shaded 5%",
                   xlab = "Fluorescence intensity",
                   ylab = "Density")
  
  legend(2, 0.37,
         legend = c("Population", "Sample"),
         col = c("#de3765", "#7cb5ec"),
         lty = c(2,2), lwd = c(2,2), bty = "n")
  
}
```

</div>

<div class='right' style='float:right;width:48%'>
The **confidence level** represents the percentage of intervals that would include the population parameter if you took samples from the same population again and again.
